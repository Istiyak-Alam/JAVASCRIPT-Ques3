Q.1 :- Write the Code for all Data types.

Answer :- let variable = 'This is a string';
          console.log(typeof variable); // string

          variable = 123;
          console.log(typeof variable); // number

          variable = true;
          console.log(typeof variable); // boolean

          variable = null;
          console.log(typeof variable); // object

          variable = undefined;
          console.log(typeof variable); // undefined

          variable = {a: 1, b: 2};
          console.log(typeof variable); // object

          variable = [1, 2, 3];
          console.log(typeof variable); // object

          variable = function() { return 'Hello, world!'; };
          console.log(typeof variable); // function


Q.2 :- What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?

Answer :- Arithmetic Operators: They perform mathematical operations on operands. For example, +, -, *, /, and %.

          Comparison Operators: They compare two operands. For example, ==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, and >=.

          Logical Operators: They are used to determine the logic between variables or values. For example, &&, ||, and !.

          Conditional (Ternary) Operator: It is used to perform a condition check. For example, condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse.

          Assignment Operators: They are used to assign a value to a variable. For example, =, +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.

          Type Operators: They are used to perform operations on data types. For example, typeof, instanceof, and void.

          Bitwise Operators: They are used to perform bitwise calculations on numbers. For example, &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>, and nullish coalescing operator (??).

Q.3 :- Explain the Assignment Operator.

Answer :- The assignment operator in JavaScript is used to assign a value to a variable.
          It's denoted by a single equals sign: = .

Q.4 :- Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.

Answer :- In JavaScript, arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.
          1.Addition (+): The "+" operator is used to add two numbers together. 
          2.Subtraction (-): The "-" operator is used to subtract a number from another number.
          3.Multiplication (*): The "" operator is used to multiply two numbers together.
          4.Division (/) : The "/" operator is used to divide a number by another number. 
          5.Remainder (%): The "%" operator is used to find the remainder when one number is divided by another.
          6.Exponentiation (**): The "" operator is used to raise a number to the power of another number.
          7.Increment (++): The "++" operator is used to increment a variable by 1. It can be used as a prefix or postfix operator. 
          8.Decrement (--): The "--" operator is used to decrement a variable by 1. It can be used as a prefix or postfix operator.


Q.5 :- What are the Binary Operators in js.

Answer :- Binary operators in JavaScript are used to perform operations on two operands. The operators combine, compare, or manipulate data.

Q.6 :- Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.

Answer :- In JavaScript, increment and decrement are unary operators used to modify a variable by increasing or decreasing its value by 1.
          There are two types of increment operators in JavaScript:

          1.Pre-Increment (++):-The value of the variable is incremented by 1 before any operations in the line of code are executed.
          Ex:-let x = 10;
              let y = ++x;
              console.log(y);// Outputs: 11

          2.Post-Increment (++):-The value of the variable is incremented by 1 after all operations in the line of code are executed.
          Ex:-let x = 10;
              let y = x++;
              console.log(y);// Outputs: 10
